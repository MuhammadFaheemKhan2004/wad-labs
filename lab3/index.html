            involves
            understanding an area's heat and sunshine, rain and wind, or its dryness and cloudiness.Each weather
            variable is described by a known theoretical probability distribution but the values of the parameters
            describing each distribution are dependent on the occurrence of rainfall.
            Weather is defined as the state of the atmosphere at a given time and place, with respect to variables such
            as temperature, moisture, wind speed and direction, and barometric pressure.

        <h3><strong>Pakistan Maetrological Department</strong></h3>
        <p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) (Urdu: محکمہ موسمیات پاکستان, also known as Pakistan Met
            Office[3][4]), is an autonomous and independent institution tasked with providing weather forecasts and
            public warnings concerning weather for protection, safety and general information.[1]

            Apart from meteorology, it is also involved in monitoring as well as investigating weather phenomena,
            astronomical events, hydrology and research in astrophysics, climate change, aeronautical engineering, and
            renewable energy resources across various parts of the country.[1] It is headquartered in Islamabad.

            Till 1991, PMD was providing aviation weather services to defence forces through regular deputation of
            meteorologists to PAF. However in 1991, PAF formed its own Met branch, and officers are now inducted on a
            regular basis in PAF to meet aviation requirements. The main training for meteorologists is, however,
            imparted by PMD at Pakistan Institute of Meteorology and Geo Physics Karachi, through formally recognized
            courses. PAF Met branch is now providing weather services to PAF, Army, Navy, and paramilitary forces. PAF's
            main Met offices are located in Karachi, Jacobabad, Shorkot, Sargodha, Mianwali, Rawalpindi, Kamra, Risalpur
            and Peshawar.

            PMD has offices and research facilities in all provinces and territories of the country.[5]
            <br>

            <strong>History</strong>
            Shortly after independence in 1947, the Pakistan Meteorological Department was established and inherited 15
            meteorological observatories from the Central Meteorological Organization of the British Raj.[2] In 1948,
            PMD began providing basic weather forecast to Pakistan's print media. In the 1950s, the meteorological
            department became one of the leading scientific institutions in Pakistan; concerning itself in the field of
            research in space and atmospheric sciences, it worked in close coordination with the Ministry of Defence
            (MoD) and the Ministry of Environment (MoEn) for reporting accurate weather information for aviation and
            hydrography. In the 1960s, the meteorological department was split and the Pakistan Navy Hydrographic
            Department was established for the Pakistan Navy. Some of Pakistan's most notable and reputable scientists
            have been affiliated with the PMD. It assisted the federal government in establishing the SUPARCO in 1961,
            where many of its atmospheric scientists and technical staff joined the new space agency.[6] The PMD has
            also assisted and lead studies in the Geomagnetic Field Monitoring Program of SUPARCO.[7] Since its
            establishment, the PMD has become one of the leading governmental scientific institution in guiding the
            government in environmental and space policy formation.[1] In 1965, the first televised weather forecast was
            broadcast by PTV. Since 1974, the meteorological department has been collecting data on seismic activity in
            Pakistan and thus is able to act as a consultant in seismic design of dams, buildings as well as disaster
            relief schemes.[1] PMD's flood forecasting system has assisted the other government departments as well.[1]
